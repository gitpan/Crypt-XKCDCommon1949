NAME
    Crypt::XKCDCommon1949 - xkcd password style wordlist provider

SYNOPSIS
       use Crypt::XKCDCommon1949 qw(xkcd_common_1949);
       my @wordlist = xkcd_common_1949;

       # but you probably want to use the interface to Crypt::Diceware
       # or Crypt::XkcdPassword or Acme::MetaSyntatic described below

DESCRIPTION
    Crypt::XKCDCommon1949 providers a simple wordlist based on the 1949
    english words most frequently occurening in newspapers published by
    <http://passphra.se> (which is in turn based on data published at
    <http://www.paulnoll.com/Books/Clear-English/English-3000-common-words.h
    tml>)

    This list of words is handy as it represents a compromise between having
    a reasonable number of words to pick from (almost 11 bits of entropy per
    word) and having a word that someone is likely to be able to remember.

    Please be aware that while passwords generated with this wordlist are
    much more secure than the standard type "human readable" password if
    many randomly picked words are used to constuct a password, the
    passwords are not as secure as less readable passwords consisting of
    random characters (such as those generated by password vault software
    such as 1Password.) Use at your own risk.

  Exported Symbols
    Can be exported on demand or used fully qualified

    xkcd_common_1949
        Function returning 1949 common english words.

    @words
        Array containing 1949 common english words.

  Using this module with other Perl modules
    Support is baked in for other modules:

    Crypt::Diceware
        Crypt::Diceware is the most secure of the options listed here, using
        proper random numbers to pick the words. It requires non-pure-perl
        dependancies however.

          use Crypt::Diceware words => { wordlist => 'XKCDCommon1949' }
          say join " ", words(4);

    Crypt::XkcdPassword
        Crypt::XkcdPassword can be configured to use proper random numbers,
        but by default (as in the example shown below) it doesn't.

          say Crypt::XkcdPassword->new( words => "XKCDCommon1949" )
                                 ->make_password(4);

    Acme::MetaSyntatic
        For completeness. Doesn't have proper random number generator,
        relies on List::Util's "shuffle" method to do the random picking.

           use Acme::MetaSyntactic qw( xkcdcommon1949 );
           say join " ", metaxkcdcommon1949(4);
